# Traffic-Image-Processing-Computer-Vision-

Intended to analyze the relationship between different constructions of CNN vs the performance on classifying Traffic sign image data. Intiated Exploratory data analysis, then constructing the convolutional neural network, then augmenting the image data inputs. Following that we tried different existing large neural net work to test transfer learning performance. Last we made visualization on the runtime and accuracy.
